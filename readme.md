# Conditions in C#

This README provides an overview of the basic conditional statements in C#. These are essential for decision-making in your programs.

## if Statement

The `if` statement allows you to execute a block of code if a specified condition is true.

```csharp
int a = 10;
if (a > 5)
{
    Console.WriteLine("a is greater than 5");
}
```

## else Statement

The `else` statement allows you to execute a block of code if the condition in the `if` statement is false.

```csharp
int a = 3;
if (a > 5)
{
    Console.WriteLine("a is greater than 5");
}
else
{
    Console.WriteLine("a is not greater than 5");
}
```

## else if Statement

The `else if` statement allows you to check multiple conditions.

```csharp
int a = 5;
if (a > 5)
{
    Console.WriteLine("a is greater than 5");
}
else if (a == 5)
{
    Console.WriteLine("a is equal to 5");
}
else
{
    Console.WriteLine("a is less than 5");
}
```

## switch Statement

The `switch` statement allows you to select one of many code blocks to be executed.

```csharp
int day = 3;
switch (day)
{
    case 1:
        Console.WriteLine("Monday");
        break;
    case 2:
        Console.WriteLine("Tuesday");
        break;
    case 3:
        Console.WriteLine("Wednesday");
        break;
    default:
        Console.WriteLine("Another day");
        break;
}
```

## Ternary Operator

The ternary operator is a shorthand for `if-else` statements and is useful for simple conditional assignments.

```csharp
int a = 10;
string result = (a > 5) ? "a is greater than 5" : "a is not greater than 5";
Console.WriteLine(result);
```

### Example with Multiple Conditions

```csharp
int a = 5;

if (a > 5)
    Console.WriteLine("a is greater than 5");
else if (a == 5)
    Console.WriteLine("a is equal to 5");
else
    Console.WriteLine("a is less than 5");
```

### Example with switch Statement

```csharp
int grade = 85;
string gradeLetter;

switch (grade / 10)
{
    case 10:
    case 9:
        gradeLetter = "A";
        break;
    case 8:
        gradeLetter = "B";
        break;
    case 7:
        gradeLetter = "C";
        break;
    case 6:
        gradeLetter = "D";
        break;
    default:
        gradeLetter = "F";
        break;
}

Console.WriteLine($"Your grade is: {gradeLetter}");
```

## Best Practices

- **Use Curly Braces**: Even for single-line statements, using curly braces `{}` improves readability and reduces the risk of errors when modifying code.
- **Parentheses in Ternary Operators**: Use parentheses around the condition for clarity.
  
  ```csharp
  string result = (a > 5) ? "a is greater than 5" : "a is not greater than 5";
  ```
  
- **Consistent Formatting**: Maintain consistent formatting for readability and maintainability.

## Conclusion

Understanding and using conditional statements effectively is fundamental to controlling the flow of your C# programs. These constructs enable you to implement complex decision-making logic and improve the overall functionality of your applications.
